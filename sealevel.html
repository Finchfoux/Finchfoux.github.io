                When ice melts it turns into it's liquid form called water. The ice caps are melting into the ocean, creating more 
                and more water in the ocean. This effects what is called the "sea level" or in other terms the elevation at which the 
                water line lays. If the elevation continues to rise then beaches and costal towns will be forced to move back as a result. 
                The entire town would be flooded by knee-deep water. Children, toddlers, dogs, and babies would be forced to swim or drown. 
                Port cities where trade is essential will be entirely lost. The biggest countries in the entire world will lose billions
