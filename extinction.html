            <p class="section-text"><strong>As the Earth gets warmer and warmer, certain animals which relied on colder temperatures to survive are starting 
                to become extinct. The warming of the planet has destroyed many of their homes and has devastated entire ecosystems. This extends not only 
                to animals but to plants as well. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/14/climate-change-study-plant-animal-extinction/4760646002/#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20all%20animal%20and%20plant%20species%20on%20the%20planet%20could%20face%20extinction%20by%202070%20due%20to%20climate%20change">
                A study found that by the year 2070 roughly one-third of all plant and animal species on the planet could be facing extinction. </a>
                This would be extremely devastating to the food chain and global economy of the planet. Some towns and countries survive solely by 
                exporting animal parts. Not only do animals and plants have to compete against the enviornment, but against humans as well. over-population 
                has lead to humans needing to build more homes and buildings to accommodate for the excess population. Along with this, animals were already 
                being over hunted.

            <p class="section-text"><strong>Unfortunately, there is no way to repair the damage that has already been done to the 
                animals. What we can do is prevent further depopulation and spread of greenhouse gasses. If we start cutting down on greenhouse gasses now 
                we can prevent further destruction to these ecosystems. For the animals we could also designate safe-havens for them. This would allow the 
                animals to live and repopulate their species in peace without threat of their habitats being destroyed.
