            <p class="section-text"><strong>As the Earth gets warmer and warmer, the polar ice caps have been slowly melting. 
                These ice caps are melting at alarming rates. <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/six-ways-loss-of-arctic-ice-impacts-everyone#:~:text=We%20lose%20Arctic%20sea%20ice%20at%20a%20rate%20of%20almost%2013%25%20per%20decade">We lose, on average, about <strong>13%</strong> of the ice caps every 
                decade.</a> These are very worrying statistics. With the current trend of rising temperatures we may have no ice caps by 
                the year 2040. With this the entire <a href="sealevel.html">sea level <strong>will</strong> rise</a>. Without the ice caps,
                and with the increased temperatures, we may never experience a lot of things again. We may never see snow ever again. Even in
                places such as Canada and Norway where it snows nearly year-round. In hotter weather we may be unable to grow certain foods. 
                Even animals will begin to become rare and <a href="extinction.html">extinct</a>. Under a vast amount of the ice is <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/methane">methane</a>, 
                which is a dangerous greenhouse gas. Methane contributes to global warming. These means that the ice caps will exponentially melt, in turn releasing more gas and 
                speeding up the process.

            <h2 class="section-header">How to Remedy the Ice Caps and Rising Sea Levels<h2>
            <p class="section-text"><strong>Unfortunately, there is no way to repair the damage that has already been done to the 
                ice caps. What we can do is prevent further erosion and spread of greenhouse gasses and prevent the rise 
                of the <a href="sealevel.html">sea levels</a>. In order to stop the melting we need to deploy modern engineering and creative 
                problem solving. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding">
                Using scientific tools such as dams and man-made islands we can halt the melting and rising of sea levels. </a> This is 
                only a part of the fight for the planet. This is also a monsterous undertaking that will take multiple years to 
                complete. That is why it is important that we begin to get started now. Every step in the right direction is a step 
                towards a brighter, cleaner, and safer tomorrow for us and our families.
